## The Protagonists of Rabbinic Literature

> Mishnah Pirkei Avot 1:1-3a (trans. Kulp, <https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.2>): **Moses** received the Torah at Sinai and transmitted it to **Joshua**, Joshua to the **elders**, and the elders to the **prophets**, and the prophets to the **Men of the Great Assembly**. They said three things: Be patient in [the administration of] justice, raise many disciples and make a fence round the Torah.  
> **Shimon the Righteous** was one of the last of the men of the great assembly. He used to say: the world stands upon three things: the Torah, the Temple service, and the practice of acts of piety.  
> **Antigonus a man of Socho** received [the oral tradition] from Shimon the Righteous.

## The Protagonists of Rabbinic Literature

> Avot d'Rabbi Natan A4:5 (trans. Kasher, <https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D'Rabbi_Natan.4.5>): ... They came to Vespasian, and they opened the coffin, and [Rabbi Yohanan] got up and stood before him. He said: So you are Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai. Ask for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you. He replied: I ask nothing from you except for Yavneh. I will go there and teach my students, and I will establish prayer, and I will do all the mitzvot [mentioned in the Torah].

## Highlights of Jewish-Christian Relations before the Rise of Islam

- Christianity did not grow out of _Rabbinic_ Judaism (the form well-known today), but rather out of Second-Temple Judaism and its basis in earlier Israelite religion as expressed in the Tanakh. 

## Highlights of Jewish-Christian Relations before the Rise of Islam

- Shared but with differing understandings: Monotheism, Prophecy, Tanakh, Messiah, Covenant
- Points of Differentiation: Jesus, New Covenant/Testament, Commandments, Structures
- Sharing & Differentiation (i.e., entanglement) were discussed, debated, and reiterated over several centuries

## Highlights of Jewish-Christian Relations before the Rise of Islam

- Shared experiences 
  - as monotheistic minorities in Greco-Roman ("pagan") and Persian culture
  - through east/west difference
- Role reversal: Christianity as illegal, sometimes persecuted to tolerated and powerful; Judaism as legal and tolerated to oppressed and persecuted

## Important Themes for the Rise of Islam

- Monotheism
- Revelation through prophecy and scripture
- Exegesis (interpretation of scripture) through oral and written means
- Correct belief (orthodoxy) and correct practice (orthopraxy)
