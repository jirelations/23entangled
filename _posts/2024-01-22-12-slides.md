## Review: Tradition/Rules & Rulers

- <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Previous Objective: Describe why _hadith_ and _fiqh_ (jurisprudence) became important for establishing a civil society that included both Muslims and non-Muslims.

## Review: Tradition/Rules & Rulers

- In many regions, the populations Muslim rulers governed were majority non-Muslim for several centuries. (Bulliet's work should be correctly interpreted!)
- "Islamic" rule had to be defined. How should the Quran apply to the governance of society, including non-Muslims? ("Islamicate" as an alternate term for the period/region.)
- Lots of sources: religious, legal, literary, documentary

## Review: Tradition

- Muslim communities, like Jewish and Christian ones before them, faced the question of how to interpret scripture.
- Traditions for interpreting the Quran included
  - What did Muhammad say or do? (Including _hadith_ and the _sira_, biography of Muhammad)
  - When/in what circumstances were certain portions of the Quran revealed? (_asbab al-nuzul_, occasions of revelation)

## Review: Tradition

- Hadith as a means to interpret the Quran
  - _isnad_ (chain of transmission) + _matn_ (content)
  - Example: whether drinking wine is permissible
  - hadith criticism (traditional and modern)
  - debate over hadith's importance came to a head in 3rd/9th century, a major impetus for the Sunni development of Islam

## Review: _Fiqh_ (jurisprudence)

- civil & religious law difficult to distinguish in late antique societies
- Jewish and Christian jurisprudence included not just "religious" (i.e., cultic) aspects but also family law, dispute arbitration, etc.
- _sharia_ wasn't originally a rigid set of predetermined fundamentalist rules but rather an ideal of finding the right "path" through interpretation (compare Jewish _halakhah_)

## Review: _Fiqh_ (jurisprudence)

- _Ahl al-dhimma_ - non-Muslim subjects protected by agreements with Muslims, with certain requirements (such as payment of the _jizya_ tax)
- The "Covenant of Umar" - a retrospective generalization (ca. 9th cent.?) of various restrictions on _ahl al-dhimma_, e.g. places of worship, dress, weapons
- Legal pluralism & "forum shopping"

## Today's Objective

<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Describe why _hadith_ and _fiqh_ (jurisprudence) became important for establishing a civil society that included both Muslims and non-Muslims.
