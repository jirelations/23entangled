# Entangled Stories 

### The History of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations in the Premodern Near East

### 7. Martyrs/East & West

Winter Semester 2023  
Prof. Dr. Nathan Gibson

## Review: Parting of the Ways

- The early Jesus movement as a Jewish movement (Jesus, baptism, Peter, Paul) -- but for how long?
- "New Covenant" or "New Testament" as a framework for relating the teachings and actions of Jesus as Messiah to the commandments of Torah
- Problematic sources (history by the winners)

## Review: Parting of the Ways

- Theses of a Long Parting of the Ways
  - **Scripture**: Many New Testament writings can be understood *within* the framework of 1st-century CE Jewish thought.
  - **Authority**
  - **Lived Religion**

## Review: Parting of the Ways

  - **Authority**: The theological disputes of the first centuries reflect not two camps ("Christian" vs. "Jewish") but many more.
    - Disputes included accusations (in both directions?)
    - Debated but ultimately kept: Tanakh/Old Testament, belief in YHWH God of Israel

## Review: Parting of the Ways

  - **Authority**: The theological disputes of the first centuries reflect not two camps ("Christian" vs. "Jewish") but many more.
    - Received and re-signified as New Covenant rituals: Mikveh (cleansing) -> baptism, Passover -> communion & Passion Week
    - Debated and ultimately recast as non-obligatory (or even harmful) practices in the New Covenant: circumcision, purity laws (food & washing), Sabbath observance

## Review: Parting of the Ways
  - **Lived Religion**: The attempts by religious leaders to draw boundaries between communities show what normal people were *actually* doing.
    - Trying to separate observance of festivals (Passover vs. Easter)
    - Trying to regulate family law (preventing intermarriage)

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe what martyrs contributed to the ideology of late antique religion.
2. Give some examples of political, cultural, and religious differences between eastern and western Christian and Jewish communities.
