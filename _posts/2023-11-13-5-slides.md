## Background in Tanakh

- Kings

> 1 Samuel 10:1 (ESV): Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him and said, “Has not the LORD anointed you to be prince over his people Israel?

> 1 Samuel 16:13 (ESV): Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers.

## Background in Tanakh

- High Priests

> Exodus 40:13–15 (ESV): and put on Aaron the holy garments. And you shall anoint him and consecrate him, that he may serve me as priest. 14 You shall bring his sons also and put coats on them, 15 and anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may serve me as priests. And their anointing shall admit them to a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.

## Background in Tanakh

- Prophets

> 1 Kings 19:16 (ESV): And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place. 

## Background in Tanakh

- Recurring mentions of David and his throne

> Isaiah 9:2,4,6-7 (ESV): The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone ... 4 For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian. ... 6 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 7 Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore.

## Background in Talmud



> Einleuchtend ist es nach demjenigen, welcher sagt, um den **Messias, den Sohn Josephs**, der dann getötet wird, denn es heißt:*sie werden auf den blicken, den sie durchbohrten, und um ihn trauern, wie man um den Einzigen trauert* ... 

## Background in Talmud

> Die Rabbanan lehrten: Der Heilige, gepriesen sei er, wird zum **Messias, dem Sohne Davids**, der gar schnell, in unseren Tagen, erscheinen wird, sprechen : *Verlange etwas von mir, und ich will es dir gewähren. Denn es heißt :ich will den Beschluß kundtun &c. Verlange von mir, so will ich dir die Völker zum Erbe geben.* Sobald er aber sehen wird, daß der **Messias, der Sohn Josephs**, getötet wird, wird er vor ihm sprechen: Herr der Welt, ich verlange von dir nichts weiter als Leben! Darauf wird er zu ihm sprechen: Bevor du noch um Leben bittest, weissagte dein Ahn David über dich, denn es heißt :Leben erbat er von dir, du gabest ihm &c. (b. Sukkah 52a,3,6; Goldschmidt 1929)

## Geheimnis: Tanakh und Talmud überbrücken 

How many Messiahs?  
- zero (Messianic Age)?
- Messiah son of David?
- + Messiah son of Joseph (=son of Ephraim)? 
- multiple? 

The Roman period as the key
