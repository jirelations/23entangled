## Review: Rabbis

- Rabbis as political leaders?
  - Jews in late Roman Empire: revolts crushed, then tolerated as citizens, finally oppressed
  - Sanhedrin/Patriarchate (judicial elders) were sometimes recognized by Roman authorities.
  - Only partial overlap between Sanhedrin and rabbis (e.g., Judah ha-Nasi, traditional transmitter of Mishnah)

## Review: Rabbis

- Rabbis as religious leaders?
  - Rabbis present themselves in Mishnah & Talmud as authorities, but when did they really become this?
  - Synagogues in the first few centuries seem to have been built without reference to rabbinic rules and authority (compare Lee Levine)
    - Hellenizing features: a sign of weak rabbinic authority or of hellenized rabbis?

## 1. What does the Quran say about itself? 

> Q 85 (al-Buruj) 21-22 (Saheeh International):  
بَلْ هُوَ قُرْءَانٌۭ مَّجِيدٌۭ   
But this is an honored Qur’ān  
فِى لَوْحٍۢ مَّحْفُوظٍۭ   
[Inscribed] in a Preserved Slate.

## 1. What does the Quran say about itself? 

> Q 17 (al-Isra) 78 (Saheeh International):  
أَقِمِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ لِدُلُوكِ ٱلشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَقُرْءَانَ ٱلْفَجْرِ ۖ إِنَّ قُرْءَانَ ٱلْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًۭا   
Establish prayer at the decline of the sun [from its meridian] until the darkness of the night and [also] the Qur’ān [i.e., recitation] of dawn. Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed.

## 1. What does the Quran say about itself?

> Q 27 (al-Naml) 1-3 (Saheeh International):  
طسٓ ۚ تِلْكَ ءَايَـٰتُ ٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَكِتَابٍۢ مُّبِينٍ   
Ṭā, Seen. These are the verses of the Qur’ān [i.e., recitation] and a clear Book  
هُدًۭى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ   
As guidance and good tidings for the believers  
ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَهُم بِٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ   
Who establish prayer and give zakāh, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].

## 1. What does the Quran say about itself?

> Q 2 (al-Baqara) (185):  
شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ هُدًۭى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَـٰتٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَانِ ۚ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ ٱلشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ ۖ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍۢ فَعِدَّةٌۭ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ ۗ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا۟ ٱلْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَىٰكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ   
The month of Ramaḍān [is that] in which was revealed the Qur’ān, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the crescent of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allāh intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allāh for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful.

## 1. What does the Quran say about itself?

> Q 41 (Fussilat) 44 (Saheeh International):  
وَلَوْ جَعَلْنَـٰهُ قُرْءَانًا أَعْجَمِيًّۭا لَّقَالُوا۟ لَوْلَا فُصِّلَتْ ءَايَـٰتُهُۥٓ ۖ ءَا۬عْجَمِىٌّۭ وَعَرَبِىٌّۭ ۗ قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ هُدًۭى وَشِفَآءٌۭ ۖ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌۭ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍۭ بَعِيدٍۢ   
And if We had made it a foreign [i.e., non-Arabic] Qur’ān, they would have said, "Why are its verses not explained in detail [in our language]? Is it a foreign [recitation] and an Arab [messenger]?" Say, "It is, for those who believe, a guidance and cure." And those who do not believe - in their ears is deafness, and it is upon them blindness. Those are being called from a distant place.

## 3. Significance of Quran's Origins

What impact does the Quran's statements about Jews and Christians and its use of biblical material have?

- Quran as revelation in a vacuum: no engagement necessary. What the Quran says is simply fact from an Islamic perspective, no matter how much Jews and Christians might protest.
- Muhammad as an exceptional individual: Focus on the biography of Muhammad and what he himself knew and thought.

## 3. Significance of Quran's Origins

- Quran as derivative: The Quran's statements about Jews and Christians are secondary and only partially informed or misinformed, hindering further understanding until today.

## 4. A Middle View

## 4. A Middle View

What impact does the Quran's statements about Jews and Christians and its use of biblical material have?

- Quran in dialogue: The Quran's statements about Jews and Christians are meant to critique their positions. They model a conversational posture for Muslims rather than a set of dogmas they must believe about non-Muslims.
