## Review: A Common Language

Previous Objective: <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Describe how Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions both contributed _to_ "Golden Age" Arabic written culture and were themselves transformed _by_ it. 

## Review: A Common Language

- Arabic as a "super" _lingua franca_
- A great convergence of practices and knowledge through the use of Arabic from many language traditions (Greek, Syriac, Persian and others)
  - as seen in
    - writing & knowledge practices (book production, administration, translation, teaching circles)
    - literary forms (authored prose works such as scholarly treatises, belletristic, mirror for princes, _kalam_, literary dialogue/debate)
    - specific fields (medicine, astronomy, grammar & lexicography, mathematics & numerals, philosophy & theology, scriptural commentary & exegesis)
{: .r-fit-text}

## Review: A Common Language

- Great convergence (cont.)
  - significant as
    - a synthesis (whirlpool/transculturation)
    - a "golden age" of collaborative knowledge production (not just Islam)

## Review: A Common Language

- Inner transformations
  - Jewish & Christian communities using Arabic for themselves, including to read the Bible, in services, and for doing theology
  - Discussion between communities using _kalam_

## Review: A Common Language

- Inner transformations (cont.)
  - Engagement with Arabic brought about literary transformations
    - Formation of medieval Jewish literature
    - Syriac Renaissance
    - 12th cent. European Renaissance

## Today's Objective

<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Describe the impact of the 11th-13th cent. regimes on the (1) social status, (2) connectedness, and (3) outside perceptions of Near Eastern Jews, Christians, and Muslims.

## Intro: Patterns

- social status: varying, but only those of the ruler's religion are 1st-class citizens
- connectedness: communities in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq/Iran separated by political developments
- outside perceptions: neighbors blamed for outside developments

## Intro: Patterns

- **Empires, nation states, and borders** fail to describe the complex and fluid political realms of this period.
- **Military masters** dominate (and sometimes seize power from) political figureheads.
